# Global-Pandemic-Data-Processing-Assessment

A data processing task with the Global Pandemic (COVID-19) dataset. Analysis using simple moving average (SMA) to understanding the daily increment in cases.

<b>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</b> uses a sliding window to take the average over a set number of time periods. It is an equally weighted mean of the previous n data. For the assessment, I calculate SMA for a window size of 3 and 4, which means you will consider three values each time (3/4 days) to calculate the moving average, and for every new value, the oldest value will be ignored.
